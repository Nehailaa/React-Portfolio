                  I plan to further my studies by earning a certificate in full stack
                  development from Southern Methodist University and develop skills in
                  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, and responsive web design. I am
                  excited to use the skills I have as part of a quality-driven team to
                  build accessible and responsive websites and apps. Being analytical
                  and detail-oriented person, my personality fits the Web Developer
                  profession. Besides Coding, Accounting, Taxation and Auditing, I
                  am interested in social issues, humanitarian causes, and economics
                  news. Moreover, I have experience in customer service with a
                  demonstrated history of working in the hospitality and retail
                  industries.</p>
